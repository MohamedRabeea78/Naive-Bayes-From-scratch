Naive Bayes Classifier Formula
Where,

x1, … , xj are j features that are independent of each other. y is the dependent variable.
P(y|x1,…, xj): Posterior Probability
P(x1, …, xj|y): Likelihood of features x1 to xj given that their class is y.
P(y): Prior Probability
P(x1, …, xj): Marginal Probability
